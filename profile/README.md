# 👾 Aptos Coding Challenges

> Explore hands-on Aptos development through small, focused exercises designed to help you understand Move, on-chain logic, and common development patterns in the Aptos ecosystem.

## What is the Aptos Coding Challenge?

The **Aptos Coding Challenge** is a beginner-friendly series where developers work through simple projects containing intentional issues or incomplete components. Participants fork the repository, analyze the codebase, and submit a pull request with their solution or implementation.

By completing these exercises, you'll gradually strengthen your Move development skills and gain practical experience to build your own  project on Aptos!

## Rules and Guidelines

1. **Original Work Only**
   Your submission must represent your own implementation. Reusing another participant’s work disqualifies the entry for that challenge.

2. **Follow the Repository Instructions**
   Each challenge includes a README with required steps. Submissions that don’t follow these instructions may not be accepted.
